# Net_worth_dynamics_through_ordinary_least_squar_regression_analysis

In this project we will take “wealth”as net worth (wealth) as dependent variable, psychological distress (pd) as key independent variable and others as control variables. 
We will describe the raw data through tables and graphs, providing initial insights of the data. We will select the appropriate regression models such like linear regression and multiple regression. After running the regressions, we will provide technical and logical interpretation of the parameters. We will also conduct CLRM tests and discuss the possible reasons when a test fails.
